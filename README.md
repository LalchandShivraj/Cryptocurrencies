# Cryptocurrencies

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. Since they are new to this venture, they need a report/analysis that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

### Task at hand:

1.	Preprocess the Data for PCA
2.	Reduce Data Dimensions using PCA
3.	Cluster Cryptocurrencies using K-means
4.	Visualize Cryptocurrencies Results

# Results

#### Provided in the Jupyter Notebook: crypto_clustering.ipynb

#### 3D Scatter with Cluster

#### 2D Scatter 


# Summary

The processing have produced classes based on their similar features. There are a couple of outliers that suggest maybe further analysis is required or they are just over/under performers.
